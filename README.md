# odin-recipes
## Odin Project for HTML
- This Project requires a foundational understanding of HTML, Git, and the command line.
- The goal is to create a basic recipe website with a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 
- The finished website will be revisited in the future once I have a foundational understanding of CSS.
